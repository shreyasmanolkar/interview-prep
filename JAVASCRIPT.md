# Javascript

### Scope
Scope in JavaScript refers to the accessibility and visibility of variables, functions, and objects within the code. It determines where in the code a variable or function can be accessed or modified. 
There are two main types of scope:

1- Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including inside functions.

2- Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function or in nested functions inside it.

The scope in JavaScript helps in organizing and encapsulating code, preventing variable collisions, and managing the lifetime of variables.
